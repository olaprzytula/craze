# Craze
#### a fictional landing page with Bootstrap

This is a landing page I created to practise Bootstrap.
<br/>It is based on a template we received during CodersLab workshop. The template was created by w3layouts (https://w3layouts.com/craze-single-page-responsive-website-template/).

## Description
This is a simple website that I used as an opportunity to teach myself a little bit of Bootstrap. It worked! I am absolutely amazed by how useful, simple and intuitive a tool it is.
<br/>
##### Created with
html, css, sass, bootstrap, flexbox

## Plugins used
##### In this project I used the help of:

- Ian Lunn's Hover.css effect Grow (https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover)
<br/>for the enlarging table effect
- Bootstrap!

## Enjoy!
